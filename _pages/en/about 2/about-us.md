### How we work with others

#### Policy
We work closely. Policy team 1) clears the bureaucracy so we can do our jobs 2) informs us of the policy landscape

#### Design
Designers & researchers are two peas in a pod. Good UX can be attributed to this pairing.

#### Devs
It’s imp to us that devs come along the user journey, understand user needs & co-create solutions

#### Product
Involve PMs in research activities to build the right product & share a compelling user story to the Partner

#### Outreach
Working together to tell the story of CDS Research and the people’s lives we help improve.

### How we need your team's help

### Commit to ensuring that items added to product backlog & sprint cycles are driven from real user research / and not team or partner assumptions 
- Partners may not know why we do user research - work alongside your researcher to prove the value to them.
- Fight to make sure you have a researcher on your team

### Get out of the office, often enough - seriously.
Nothing is more powerful than being in the field and listening to the end user tell you about their needs or how your product is not meeting them! 

### Be a research champion - involve yourself + improve your research skills
- Attend the bi-weekly Research Community Meetings on Wednesday mornings where we share research work and improve CDS internal capacity for design research
- Hang out with us, let’s get coffee :)
