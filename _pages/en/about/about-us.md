### What we do
Goal: Share information on accessibility and inclusive design.

Accessibility best practices can be complicated and change over time. 

### How we work with others

#### Policy
We work closely. Policy team 1) clears the bureaucracy so we can do our jobs 2) informs us of the policy landscape

#### Design
Designers & researchers are two peas in a pod. Good UX can be attributed to this pairing.

#### Devs
Itâ€™s imp to us that devs come along the user journey, understand user needs & co-create solutions
